// FUNCTIONS (These are bits of code that we will call upon to run when needed).
// ==================================================================================================

// startGame()
// It's how we we will start and restart the game.
// (Note: It's not being run here. Function declarations like this are made for future use.)


// checkLetters() function
// It's where we will do all of the comparisons for matches.
// Again, it's not being called here. It's just being made for future use.

// roundComplete() function
// Here we will have all of the code that needs to be run after each guess is made.




// MAIN PROCESS (THIS IS THE CODE THAT CONTROLS WHAT IS ACTUALLY RUN)
// ==================================================================

// Starts the Game by running the startGame() function
startGame();

// Then initiates the function for capturing key clicks.
document.onkeyup = function(event) {

  // Converts all key clicks to lowercase letters.
  
  // Runs the code to check for correct guesses.

  // Runs the code that ends each round.

};
