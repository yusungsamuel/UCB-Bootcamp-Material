  // Here we are given a cob-web of items. Let's dig in and grab the items we need.
  var theCobWeb = {
    biggestWeb: {
      item: "comb",
      biggerWeb: {
        items: ["glasses", "paperclip", "bubblegum"],
        smallerWeb: {
          item: "toothbrush",
          tinyWeb: {
            items: ["toenails", "lint", "wrapper", "homework"]
          }
        }
      },
      otherBigWeb: {
        item: "headphones"
      }
    }
  };

// Create the code necessary to print each of the following lines using the object above:
// "I found my glasses!"
console.log(theCobWeb.biggestWeb.biggerWeb.items[0]);
// "I found my toothbrush!"
// "I found my headphones!"
// "I found my homework!"


// Bonus (Extra Hard): It's impossible to complete this in the allotted time. Take this home as a challenge and bring it back to your TA/Instructor for the solution.
// Create a function using JavaScript (NOT jQuery) for which you can pass the name of an item and theCobWeb
// and the function returns the smallest web it was found inside of.
// Your code should work if someone were to modify theCobWeb.  
//  for example if you gave your program 
//    comb it should give back biggestWeb
//    toenails it should give back tinyWeb
//    headphones it should give back otherBigWeb
// HINT: you should use recursion
